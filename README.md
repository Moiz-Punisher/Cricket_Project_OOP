Cricket Simulation using OOP
Cricket Simulation using OOP is a C++ program that offers a comprehensive cricket simulation experience. This project utilizes various object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, including inheritance and aggregation, to create an immersive and realistic simulation.

Features

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed.
Add these file----------
Compile the main.cpp file using your preferred C++ compiler.
Run the compiled executable.
