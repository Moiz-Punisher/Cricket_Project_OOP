Cricket Simulation using OOP

Cricket Simulation using OOP is a C++ program that offers a comprehensive cricket simulation experience. This project utilizes various object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, including inheritance and aggregation, to create an immersive and realistic simulation.

Features

Score Display: View the scores of previous matches to gain historical context.

Team and Player Management: Maintain files for teams and players, ensuring accurate and up-to-date data.

Innings Files: Separate files for the first and second innings provide detailed match information.

Support Staff: A file containing commentators, umpires, and grounds allows for random selection during each match (max 5).

Autoplay Feature: Sit back and enjoy the simulation as it runs automatically, replicating a real cricket match.


Getting Started
To run the cricket simulation, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed.
Add these file "SupportStaffAndOthers.txt","Teams.txt","1stInnings.txt","2ndInnings.txt"
Compile the main.cpp file using your preferred C++ compiler.
Run the compiled executable.

Usage:
Upon running the program, you will be presented with a cricket simulation interface. Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate through the simulation. You can choose to view previous match scores, manage teams and players, and enjoy the autoplay feature after some balls .
